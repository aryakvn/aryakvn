### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Arya, a full-stack developer with more than 7 years of experience. I've built everything from custom websites and progressive web apps to automation bots that streamline tasks on social media and administrative platforms. With a foundation in electronics and a focus on clean, efficient code, I aim to create solutions that are both technically sound and user-friendly. Iâ€™m always playing around with new tech like Docker and Git to make things smoother.
